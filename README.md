Groq is a cloud API service for fast language, speech, and vision models. This Home Assistant custom integration connects a Groq account to Assist, AI Tasks, speech-to-text, text-to-speech, image analysis, and response actions.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is an unofficial community project. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or supported by Groq.
>
> Feature availability, model availability, rate limits, token limits, and billing behavior are controlled by Groq and can vary by account, project, and model.

## Supported Functionality

This integration supports Groq cloud accounts. It does not discover or control physical devices.

Supported Home Assistant platforms:

- `conversation`: Assist conversation agents backed by configured Groq text generation services.
- `ai_task`: data generation tasks for services and automations that need structured output.
- `stt`: speech-to-text entities for Home Assistant voice pipelines.
- `tts`: text-to-speech entities for `tts.speak`.

Provided response actions:

- `groq.generate_text`: generate a text response.
- `groq.generate_structured`: generate JSON or schema-shaped output.
- `groq.analyze_image`: ask a question about a camera image, media image, local image, or image URL.
- `groq.extract_text_from_image`: OCR-style text extraction from an image.
- `groq.transcribe_audio`: transcribe a local or media-source audio file.
- `groq.clear_cache`: clear the local response cache for a Groq account.
- `groq.list_models`: list models visible to a Groq account.

Each configured Groq service creates its own Home Assistant device and the relevant entity for that platform. Text generation services can create Assist and AI Task entities. Speech-to-text and text-to-speech services create STT and TTS entities.

## Installation

### HACS

1. Open HACS.
2. Search for Groq in Integrations.
3. Download Groq.
4. Restart Home Assistant.
5. Go to Settings -> Devices & services -> Add integration -> Groq.

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open the Groq repository in HACS.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=barneyonline&repository=ha-groq&category=integration)

### Manual

1. Copy `custom_components/groq` into your Home Assistant `custom_components` directory.
2. Restart Home Assistant.
3. Go to Settings -> Devices & services -> Add integration -> Groq.

## Requirements

- Home Assistant `2026.6.0` or newer. Local development is tested against the minimum supported version.
- A Groq API key from [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com/).
- Network access from Home Assistant to `https://api.groq.com`.
- Optional: `ffmpeg` on the Home Assistant host if you enable TTS audio normalization, Long TTS, or MP3/FLAC playback output.

This integration does not use Home Assistant application credentials or OAuth. Groq API keys act as account or project credentials. Use separate Groq keys when you want separate projects, billing pools, environments, or rate-limit isolation.

## Configuration

Initial account setup asks for:

- Name: friendly name for this Groq account in Home Assistant.
- Groq API key: secret key used for Groq API requests. The key is stored by Home Assistant and redacted from diagnostics.

After adding an account, open the Groq integration page and add one or more services:

- Text Generation: name, model, system prompt, temperature, free-tier protection, and optional advanced request options.
- Speech-to-Text: name, model, language hint, and free-tier protection.
- Text-to-Speech: name, model, voice, output format, optional vocal directions, optional audio normalization, optional Long TTS, and free-tier protection.
- Image Recognition: name, model, system prompt, and free-tier protection.

Advanced Text Generation options include max completion tokens, top P, stop sequences, seed, service tier, streaming, reasoning options, local response caching, Compound built-in tool allow-lists, structured output schema, strict schema mode, and additional Groq request body options.

Compound built-in tools are opt-in. For `groq/compound` and `groq/compound-mini`, the integration sends an explicit empty built-in tool allow-list unless you enable tools such as web search, visit website, browser automation, code execution, or Wolfram Alpha in the service's advanced options. Enabling these tools allows Groq to run server-side tools and inspect external content for the request.

You can add more than one Groq account. The integration prevents adding the same API key twice.

## Known Limitations

- This is a cloud integration and will not work without internet access to Groq.
- Groq can change model availability, limits, and request option support outside this integration.
- Some advanced options work only on models that support them. The setup flow validates known model capabilities where possible.
- TTS input is limited by Groq Orpheus model limits. Enable the Long TTS option to split longer announcements and stitch them with `ffmpeg`; this uses more CPU and more Groq request quota. Without Long TTS, overly long requests are blocked locally.
- Groq Orpheus currently generates WAV audio. The integration can use `ffmpeg` to convert playback output to MP3 for broad speaker compatibility or FLAC for lossless playback on supported speakers.
- Long TTS, audio normalization, and playback conversion need `ffmpeg` and use extra CPU.
- This integration does not discover devices. It supports Groq cloud accounts and user-created Groq service entries.

## Troubleshooting

- Invalid API key: create or copy a fresh key from Groq Console, then reauthenticate the Groq integration entry.
- Cannot connect: check Home Assistant network/DNS access to `api.groq.com` and the [Groq status page](https://groqstatus.com/).
- Model missing: use `groq.list_models` to see models visible to the selected account, or choose a known compatible model.
- Multiple accounts or services: provide `config_entry_id` or `service_id` in the action data so Home Assistant can select the intended Groq account or service.
- Rate-limit errors: wait for Groq's reset window, lower automation frequency, choose a smaller model, or use separate Groq projects/keys where appropriate.
- TTS audio processing fails: install `ffmpeg` on the Home Assistant host, choose WAV playback output when conversion is enabled, or disable audio normalization and Long TTS.
- Local image or audio file fails: make sure the path is allowed by Home Assistant `allowlist_external_dirs`, or use a media-source file.
- Diagnostics: download diagnostics from the integration page. API keys and prompt fields are redacted.

## Removal

1. Go to Settings -> Devices & services -> Groq.
2. Delete any Groq service entries you no longer want.
3. Delete the Groq account entry.
4. Restart Home Assistant if you plan to remove the custom integration files.
5. If installed through HACS, remove Groq from HACS. For a manual install, delete `custom_components/groq`.

Removing the integration stops future Groq API calls from Home Assistant. It does not delete Groq projects, keys, billing data, or logs in Groq Console.
